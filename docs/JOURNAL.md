# RE journal

Append-only log of confirmed facts and attempts. One entry per session.

## 2026-10-02: recon

- Wrote `tools/disc_inspect.py` (raw MODE1/2352 reader, Sega CD header, ISO9660 walk/extract).
- Sega CD: IP at 0x800 (24 KB), SP at 0x6800 (6 KB), 100 ISO files.
  `SUBCODE.BIN` is Sub-CPU code. `SPxx` scripts are uncompressed ASCII with 0xFF/0xF2 control bytes.
- `DATA_*` packs: entropy ≈7, a pointer header in the 0x028000 range, and an embedded name string.
- PCE: raw image with no filesystem. The data track starts at LBA 3949; sector 1 is the IPL.
- Code-density scan (count of `RTS` = `4E75`): only IP, SP and `SUBCODE.BIN` contain significant 68000 code.
- Searched the skills registry. No retro-console RE skills exist; Ghidra and UE5 skills are listed in `SKILLS_AND_TOOLS.md`.
- Next: install a debugging emulator, set up a Ghidra project, confirm the `SUBCODE.BIN` load address, find LZKN1 in the IP.
